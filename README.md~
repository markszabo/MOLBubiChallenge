# MOLBubiChallenge
My trials and errors for the MOL Bubi Big Data Challenge (https://dms.sztaki.hu/bubi/)
# Captain's Log
2015-10-05 I registered for the challenge, got my account and datasets, started to write the Matlab code

2015-10-06 First working version to BRP. Algorithm is simple: just copy yesterday's data entirely. Basically I set it up just to test the format, and the calculations. Still got 0.501197526 points, and currently second on the leaderboard (out of 5)!
