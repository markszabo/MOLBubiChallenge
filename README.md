# MOLBubiChallenge
My trials and errors for the MOL Bubi Big Data Challenge (https://dms.sztaki.hu/bubi/)

2015-10-05 I registered for the challenge, got my account and datasets, started to write the Matlab code

2015-10-06 First working version to BRP. Algorithm is simple: just copy yesterday's data entirely. Basically I set it up just to test the format, and the calculations. Still got 0.501197526 points, and currently second on the leaderboard (out of 5)!

2015-10-07 New algorithm: get the same day from the previous week (eg Monday for Monday). Not so good, got only 0.470833630 points

2015-10-07 New algorithm: calculate the average of the previous and the next day. Almost 0.1 better with 0.594551395 points!

2015-10-07 First DSDP with the previous algorithm - the average of yesterday and tomorrow. Instant second place with 5.19271 points (here less the better)
